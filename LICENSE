                      The Licensed Work is (c) 2026 Benjamin Ryan

Additional Use Grant: You may make production use of the Licensed Work,
                      provided such use does not include offering the
                      Licensed Work to third parties on a hosted or
                      embedded basis which is competitive with Benjamin
                      Ryan's own products or services.

                      For clarity: using PureBee as a component within
                      your own product is permitted. Offering PureBee
                      itself as a hosted inference service or API is not
                      permitted without a commercial license.
